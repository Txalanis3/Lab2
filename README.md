CS 3432Computer Architecture ILab Assignment 2 â€“ RV32 InterpreterTeaching Assistant: Steven IbarraInstructional Assistant: Salvador Robles HerreraAssigned: February 16, 2022Due: February 28, 2022 @ 11:59Introduction Interpreters are computer programs that directly run a program in the given language without needing it compiled into machine language. In this lab, you will build a 32-bit RISC-V (RV32) interpreter in C that will receive, parse, and execute RISC-V instructions as strings. Your interpreter will not be a simulator as it is not mimicking the hardware operation (e.g., utilizing clock cycles), but the resulting registers and memory should reflect what you would find after executing real RV32 instructions.
